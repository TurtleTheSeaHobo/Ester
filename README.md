# Ester

Elixir-based programming language processing framework.

Ester provides tools for creating grammers (both lexical and syntactical),
parsers, and compilers for programming languages. It doesn't matter what you're
starting from or what you're trying to output: if you can formally describe it, 
it will work.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `ester` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ester, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/ester](https://hexdocs.pm/ester).
